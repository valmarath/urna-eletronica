Urna Eletrônica (Electronic Voting Machine) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. It simulates a common voting process.

## See Electronic Voting Machine in action

- Download all files and open the [index.html](https://github.com/valmarath/urna-eletronica/blob/main/index.html) file on your browser.

- To test the application, input (by clicking on the virtual keyboard of the machine), for example,'77222' in the "VEREADOR" screen, then click on the "CONFIRMA" button; After this, input '84' in the "PREFEITO" screen, then click "CONFIRMA" again.

- To test other combinations, see the [etapas.js](https://github.com/valmarath/urna-eletronica/blob/main/etapas.js).

- To see exactly how the script works and to test some of the features proposed, see the [script.js](https://github.com/valmarath/urna-eletronica/blob/main/script.js).
